## Motivation

This library was created to address the limitations of [tween.js](https://github.com/tweenjs/tween.js/), such as the silent merging of properties, lack of clear typing and mutating original values. This library offers better TypeScript compatibility, customizable merging strategies, and improved typing for a more intuitive and reliable animation experience.

---

## Usage

```tsx
import {
  createController,
  EasingFunctions,
  MergeStrategies,
} from "take-it-ease";

const controller = createController();

controller.animate({
  time: 300,
  from: { x: 20, y: -10 },
  to: { x: -10, y: 20 },
  include: ["x", "y"], // define animation target ðŸŽ¯
  easingFunction: EasingFunctions.LINEAR, // not required, default one
  strategy: MergeStrategies.INSERT_WITH_FIRST_TICK, // not required, default one
  onUpdate: (result) => {
    // result: { x: number; y: number }
  },
});

// prefferable way to call tick, but you can use anything else ðŸ˜Ž
requestAnimationFrame(controller.tick);
```

## Strategies

When using a library you can decide when to insert properties that haven't existed before.

- With `MergeStrategies.INSERT_WITH_FIRST_TICK`Â difference from target object will be added with the first tick
- With `MergeStrategies.INSERT_WITH_LAST_TICK`Â difference from target object will be added with the last tick
